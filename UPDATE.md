# Update

There is actually no "real" difference between the dark and light version of this theme. They just have different default colors and only exist to easily switch between the two versions.

Everything is the same except these files use a different theme name:

- `lib/main.coffee`
- `styles/settings.less`
- `package.json`
- `README.md`

When updating a theme, make sure to update also the other version.
