# Update

There are actually no "real" difference between the dark and light version of this theme. They just have different default colors and only exist to easily switch between two versions.

All files are the same except these files use a different name:

- `lib/main.coffee`
- `styles/settings.less`
- `package.json`
- `README.md`

When updating a theme, make sure to update also the other version.
